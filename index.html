        <section id="about">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am currently an electrical and computer engineering(ECE) student at the University of Texas at Austin. 
                I was born and raised in Laredo, Texas where I attended Sanchez Ochoa Elementary school before transferring
                to Matias de Llano Elementary School for grades 1st through 5th. For middle school, I attended Trautmann Middle 
                School for grades 6th through 8th. After middle school, I chose to attend United High School for their engineering
                magnet program as well as the various amount of good math teachers.</p>
            <h3>Roots</h3>
            <p>My mother, Patricia Torres, was born in a small town named El Salto del Agua located in San Luis. She lived there for 
                most of her life where she attended school and relocated to San Luis Potosi for high school. She graduated from high
                high school and moved to the United States where she searched for a job to settle herself in. While job searching, 
                she ran into my father in Austin, Texas and they kicked it off well before they fell in love and moved in together at
                my father's hometown house with his mother. Once my mom began to live there, she was able to find sustainable jobs where 
                made a name for herself in the accounting industry. <br>
                After several years, my mother and father had my oldest sister in 1997, my younger sister in 2002 and then finally having
                me in 2004.</p> 
            
            <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
            <p>Throughout my life, I have always anjoyed watching and participating in sports of all sorts. All throughout grade school,
                I played soccer, basketball and baseball. It wasn't until my seventh grade when I first played tackle football. Since then, 
                my favorite hobby/sport to watch and play has been football. Recently, I have been watching college football the most as I 
                have been keeping up with my Longhorns in the SEC. I enjoy debating with my friends and challenging each other's takes from
                the NBA, NFL all the way to the UFC and soccer.

        <section id="resources">
            <h2>Resources</h2>
            <p><a href="https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/">Paul's Online Math Notes</a>- I like to think of Paul's notes as the closest thing
                to perfect as far as notetaking goes. I have entire sections on my notebooks of his online notes that I like to use as introductory
                material<br>
            <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hmat.html#hmath">HyperMath</a>- HyperMath is another cool math resource that I used as introductory
            material, however, I probably didn't use HyperMath half as much as I use Paul's notes simply because of how straightforward Paul's notes are.<br>
            <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hframe.html">HyperPhysics</a>- This site CARRIED me during physics (both mechanical and quantum/EM/semiconductor).
            Everything you need to know about physics is definitely here along with conceptual explanations with their derived equations.</p>

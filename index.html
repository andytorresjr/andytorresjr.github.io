    <section id="about">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently an electrical and computer engineering(ECE) student at the University of Texas at Austin. I was born and raised in 
        Laredo, Texas where I attended Sanchez Ochoa Elementary school before transferring to Matias de Llano Elementary School for grades 
        1st through 5th. For middle school, I attended Trautmann Middle School for grades 6th through 8th. After middle school, I chose to 
        attend United High School for their engineering magnet program as well as the various amount of good math teachers.
      </p><br>

      <h3>Roots</h3>
      <p>
        My mother, Patricia Torres, was born in a small town named El Salto del Agua located in San Luis. She lived there for most of her 
        life where she attended school and relocated to San Luis Potosi for high school. She graduated from high high school and moved to the 
        United States where she searched for a job to settle herself in. While job searching, she ran into my father in Austin, Texas and they 
        kicked it off well before they fell in love and moved in together at my father's hometown house with his mother. Once my mom began to 
        live there, she was able to find sustainable jobs where made a name for herself in the accounting industry. After several years, my 
        mother and father had my oldest sister in 1997, my younger sister in 2002 and then finally having me in 2004.
      </p><br>

      <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
      <p>
        Throughout my life, I have always enjoyed watching and participating in sports of all sorts. All throughout grade school, I played 
        soccer, basketball and baseball. It wasn't until my seventh grade when I first played tackle football. Since then, my favorite 
        hobby/sport to watch and play has been football. Recently, I have been watching college football the most as I have been keeping up 
        with my Longhorns in the SEC. I enjoy debating with my friends and challenging each other's takes from the NBA, NFL all the way to 
        the UFC and soccer.

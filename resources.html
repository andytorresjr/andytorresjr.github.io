        <p><a href="https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/">Paul's Online Math Notes</a>- I like to think of Paul's notes as the closest thing
            to perfect as far as notetaking goes. I have entire sections on my notebooks of his online notes that I like to use as introductory
            material<br>
        <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hmat.html#hmath">HyperMath</a>- HyperMath is another cool math resource that I used as introductory
        material, however, I probably didn't use HyperMath half as much as I use Paul's notes simply because of how straightforward Paul's notes are.<br>
        <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hframe.html">HyperPhysics</a>- This site CARRIED me during physics (both mechanical and quantum/EM/semiconductor).
        Everything you need to know about physics is definitely here along with conceptual explanations with their derived equations.</p>

        <p>These are just a few of the resources I have used and continue to use throughout my engineering journey. I will be adding more resources as I find them
            and as I continue to learn more about engineering.</p>
